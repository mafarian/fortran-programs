# fortran-programs

I worked in 3 optimization problems using Fortran 77:
* 2019 presidential election's simulation
* coulomb energy's minimization in a 'd' dimension "box" containing 'c' particules
* coulomb energy's minimization in a 'd' dimension "ball" containing 'c' particules (using 2 different techniques)
